# Enable Internet connectivity for an IPv6 address

This topic describes how to enable Internet bandwidth for an IPv6 address. After Internet bandwidth is enabled for an IPv6 address, the IPv6 address can be used to communicate over the Internet.

An ECS instance is created in the VPC associated with the corresponding IPv6 gateway and is configured with an IPv6 address.

1.  Log on to the [IPv6 gateway console](https://vpc.console.aliyun.com/ipv6).

2.  Select the region where the IPv6 gateway resides.

3.  On the **IPv6 Gateway** page, find the target IPv6 gateway, and click **Manage** in the **Actions** column.

4.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **IPv6 Internet Bandwidth**.

5.  On the **IPv6 Internet Bandwidth** page, find the target IPv6 address, and click **Enable IPv6 Internet Bandwidth** in the **Actions** column.
